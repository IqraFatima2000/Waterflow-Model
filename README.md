## Advantages
Some advantages of Waterfall mathodology are following:
+ Use Clear Structure
    Each project goes through following steps:
    + Requirements Gathering and Documentation
    + System Design
    + Implementation
    + Testing
    + Deployment
    + Maintenance
+ Determines the End Goal Early

   Unlike other methodologies like Scrum, which divides project up to indivisual sprints, Waterfall keeps focus on end goal all the time.
   
+ Transfers information Well

    Waterfall prioritizes accessible information so new additions to the team can get up to speed quickly if needed.
